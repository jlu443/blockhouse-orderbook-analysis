    "# Blockhouse Order Book Analysis: Temporary Price Impact Modeling\n",

    "This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of temporary price impact functions g_t(x) using high-frequency order book data from three securities: CRWV, FROG, and SOUN.\n",

    "\n",
    "We implement and analyze a sophisticated Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) based model for temporary market impact, demonstrating why linear models g_t(x) â‰ˆ Î²_t x are insufficient for real market microstructure modeling."

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear Impact**: All three securities exhibit non-linear temporary price impact, contradicting simple linear models g_t(x) â‰ˆ Î²â‚œx.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Liquidity Dependence**: Impact functions vary significantly based on order book depth\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mathematical Framework**: The VWAP-based approach provides a realistic, data-driven model\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal Execution**: The constraint Î£áµ¢ xáµ¢ = S can be satisfied through dynamic programming approaches"
